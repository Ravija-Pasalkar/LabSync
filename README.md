# LabSync - A platform for Laboratory Management

## Problem Statement

Managing laboratory resources, booking lab slots, and reporting technical issues is a cumbersome process in many educational institutions. Faculty members struggle to find available labs equipped with the required software and hardware for extra lectures, workshops, and seminars. Lab in-charges also face difficulties in efficiently tracking and reporting technical issues. The lack of a centralized system leads to mismanagement, scheduling conflicts, and delays in resolving technical problems.

## Proposed Solution

LabSync is a centralized and automated lab management system that simplifies lab slot booking, resource allocation, and issue reporting. It enables faculty members to efficiently reserve labs based on availability, required software, and the number of PCs. Additionally, lab in-charges can report and track technical issues, ensuring faster resolution.
